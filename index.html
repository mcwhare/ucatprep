                    <p>We understand the need for access to help at any point during the day. Having graduated in 2023, we provide up to date strategies and support to our students, ensuring that each and every one of them do NOT have to face VCE alone.</p>

                    <p>Upon enrollment, we will provide a free consultation, where we will discuss the student's fears and supposed weaknesses, and turn them into strengths by the end of the course. Along with our multitudes of available resources (Content Booklets, Worksheets and Practice Questions), we aim to track the progress of our students to ensure no one falls behind, or to extend the students who are much stronger in their capabilities.</p>

                    <p>Our smaller classes of 6-8 students are designed to provide the basis of a support group AND ensure that accountability is maintained within the group.

                      We understand that the UCAT comes with its own challenges that VCE subjects simply do not mirror and this
                      is why those who have historically performed well in an academic environment may initially struggle with
                      the UCAT. <br /><br />With our tutors each having their own unique methods of completing the UCAT, we have
                      refined these varied approaches into one idealised method, optimising the studentsâ€™ scores and increasing
                      their chances of getting into medicine.<br /><br />We were once the average UCAT student; lacking the fundamental skills that are not taught in general tutoring lessons, to perform to the best of their ability. Our tutors have learnt to work smarter and have identified recurring patterns within each subtest, and
                      have accomplished scores of well above 3000, easily surpassing the threshold to get into medicine in
                      Australia.</p>

                    <p>"Having sat the UCAT in 2023, I quickly noticed that the test was unlike any conventional SAC or VCE exam. Though I initially struggled to see any improvements, through refining my methods and technical know-how, I saw a dramatic increase in my performance which allowed me to achieve a high score. These methods are what constitute the backbone of our UCAT course."</p>

                    <p>In 2023, the minimum UCAT requirement for a first round interview at Monash was 3020 (Meaning you had to place in the top 9% of the students wishing to study medicine/dentistry). Becoming the best of the best is no easy feat, which is why it is all the more important to get ahead of the others. Furthermore, interstate universities have their UCAT cutoffs EVEN HIGHER, requiring you to place in the top 2%!</p>
