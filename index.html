            <p class="hailing">Hailing from John Monash Science School, we are used to thriving in a competitive and cutthroat setting.
                  We understand that the UCAT comes with its own challenges that VCE subjects simply do not mirror and this
                  is why those who have historically performed well in an academic environment may initially struggle with
                  the UCAT. <br /><br />With our tutors each having their own unique methods of completing the UCAT, we have
                  refined these varied approaches into one idealised method, optimising the studentsâ€™ scores and increasing
                  their chances of getting into medicine.<br /><br />We were once the average UCAT student; lacking these
                  Our tutors have learnt to work smarter and have identified recurring patterns within each subtest, and
                  have accomplished scores of well above 3000, easily surpassing the threshold to get into medicine in
                  Australia.</p>
